      <p class="f3 b lh-title">Is there a monthly fee?</p>
      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">No. Once you buy a router and install it you are part of NYC Mesh. There are no additional costs.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">Is this a replacement for my current Internet connection?</p>
      <p>Probably not at the moment. Most members are sharing their internet. If you have line-of-sight to another member or they are very close by you can ask if it is OK to share internet. We encourage people to share or make deals with their neighbors.</p>

      <p>Currently, you can use the mesh as a backup Internet connection. If you are within range of the mesh, your router will automatically use the fastest Internet connection. This means you will have a backup Internet connection if your own Internet connection fails.</p>
      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">We are talking to people about providing independent service either through an ISP or peering, but this is a while off.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">What can I do on the mesh that I can’t do on the Internet?</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">It is possible to connect directly to other people on the mesh without using the Internet. If for some reason the Internet is down, the mesh will still work. The mesh also has small web servers that show local information and allow you to chat and post messages. So far we have servers in five locations- Harlem, Bay Ridge, 3rd St. and 7th St. in the East Village, and our main directory “wiki.mesh” in Williamsburg. (We need volunteers to help add content to our servers.)</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">Why should I join the mesh now?</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">By joining the mesh now you help us grow and increase our reach across the city. This is a community project and you will be helping to create a decentralized infrastructure, free from traditional business interests.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">Is it possible for the mesh to cover a whole country?</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">Yes, there is a mesh network called “Guifi” in Spain that covers a large part of the country. In order to do this, they have a backbone of many long distance WiFi connections and also community owned fiber.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">Are you an Internet Service Provider (ISP)?</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">No, not at the moment. While we grow, we are relying on our members to share their Internet connections. Eventually we hope to peer with other providers so we can provide independent Internet service.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">What software/firmware do you use?</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">We are using an OpenWrt package made by qMp. This uses the BMX6 mesh protocol. We have added tinc tunneling so a router can mesh over the Internet when out of range using a secure virtual private network (VPN). We also have some members experimenting with and contributing to cjdns/hyperboria software. Let us know if you are interested in this.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">Can I use my own different router?</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">No, the routers we currently support and recommend are the Ubiquiti NanoStation M5 for outdoors and the TP-Link TL-WR842ND for indoors. Our <a href="../download">download page</a> has our firmware for these routers and links to buy. We sometimes have pre-configured routers at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nycmesh">meetups</a>, available at cost- $33 for the TP-Link 841ND, $55 for the TP-LINK TL-WDR3600, and $95 for the NanoStation. We do not support other routers.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">Can I install a router if I have no view or no rooftop access?</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">Yes you can. Because you may be out of range of other mesh nodes, your router will use secure VPN tunneling to connect to the mesh over the Internet. You will still see the exclusive mesh web content. Neighbors could also install our $30 routers creating a mesh for your building and reliable Internet backup.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">What is involved in a rooftop or window install?</p>

      <p>Rooftop installs are mostly done in pairs. Look at our <a href="../map">map</a> to find line-of-sight to another node location less than two miles away. You can also talk to people in the neighborhood and convince them to also install a node. We also have a collection of rooftop panoramas where you can check for possible line-of-sight connections.</p>

      <p>The other type of install is where a directional Ubiquiti router is aimed at a nearby public space (park, cafe, bar etc.) as a public Wi-Fi access point. We currently have five public spaces with this type of install.</p>

      <p>We support one outdoor router, the Ubiquiti Nanostation NSM5 (~$95). We have links for this on the <a href="../download">download page</a></p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">We can help you with the rooftop installation. Typically one or two routers are attached to a pole on the roof and an ethernet cable is run to the apartment, and connected to the TP-Link mesh router and an Internet gateway. The cable cost is $20. The ethernet cable also supplies the power to the router using “power over ethernet”. If the roof (or balcony or window) is close to your apartment you might not need an additional mesh router.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">I want a NanoStation but I’m not ready for a rooftop install</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">It is easy to use the NanoStation indoors. It is 5GHz router, and all modern phones and laptops support that. It looks a little strange but has a very good signal. If you have a long apartment or thick walls, a NanoStation is ideal.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">I can see another node from my window. Can I put a router there?</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">If you don’t have rooftop access it is still possible to use a directional NanoStation in your window. It will work from behind glass if you are unable to place it outside the window. The simplest install is to velcro the flat surface of the NanoStation NSM5 to the window.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">Why don’t we mesh mobile phones instead of routers?</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">There is “mesh” software for mobile phones such as Serval and FireChat. This is mainly used for chat messages. It stores the messages until a phone is within range and then transfers the data. Mobile “mesh” networks are very low bandwidth, not real-time and require many phones in a small area. They are great for events or some emergency situations.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">Is the mesh secure?</p>

      <p>A mesh router is firewalled from your local network. It is not possible to reach beyond the mesh router to your LAN. Mesh tunneling over the Internet is by VPN and is secure. Network traffic within the mesh is not encrypted by default.</p>

      <p class="pb3 lh-copy">If you use the internet while on the mesh, you should use standard precautions such as using https (lock icon) web sites for secure connections.</p>

      <p class="f3 b lh-title">Why aren’t you doing this obvious thing I just thought of?</p>

      <p>We have a lot on our to-do list and everyone is a volunteer. Please <a href="mailto:contact@nycmesh.net">email us</a> with suggestions, or better still volunteer to help us. We can send you an invite to our slack.com group where we do our planning. We need help with everything such as publicity, emailing, printing leaflets, writing FAQs, and installing routers on rooftops.</p>
